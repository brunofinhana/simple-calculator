# Simple Calculator
This practice project of a simple calculator that does basic math operations.<br /><br />
**Any feedback or comment is appreciated!**

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clear button to reset the calculator
- Clean, user-friendly interface

## About this project
The intention of this project was to recreate and improve the exercise, helping me fixate some foundational HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts.
The project was designed from scratch, including intial planning sketches by hand.

## Skills practiced in this project:
### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- **Structuring a Web Page:** Creating the basic layout of the calculator using HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, and `<span>`.
- **Semantic HTML:** Using appropriate tags for better accessibility (e.g., <button> for clickable buttons and <input> for display).

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- **Styling Web Pages:** Applying fonts, padding, margins, borders, and other visual elements to make the calculator look clean and user-friendly.
- **Layout with Flexbox:** Using Flexbox to create a flexible layout for the calculatorâ€™s buttons, fields and display area.
- **Animations and Transitions:** Adding subtle effects like button hover states, to enhance the user experience.

### JavaScript
- **Event Handling:** Writing functions to handle user interactions, such as clicking buttons to enter numbers or operators, and triggering the "Result" button to compute the result.
- **Basic Logic and Operators:** Implementing simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) through JavaScript.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically changing the content on the webpage based on user input. For example, updating the display screen to show numbers or results.
- **Input Validation:** Handling edge cases like division by zero or invalid input (e.g. not numbers).
- **Functions:** Writing reusable functions to handle repetitive tasks like clearing the screen or computing results.
- **Error Handling:** Displaying error messages when a user enters an invalid operation or expression (e.g., dividing by zero).

### UX/UI Design
- **User Interface Design:** Creating a clean, easy-to-use interface with simple visual feedback.
- **Accessibility:** Designing buttons that are easy to interact with, ensuring the calculator is usable on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Visual Feedback:** Providing immediate feedback on button presses or calculation results (like button animations or a changing display), and danger zones (such as the "Clear" button).

This was a great opportunity to apply and learn more about many concepts and subjects, and any feedback is appreciated!

Thanks!

P.S.: This is a refactored version of the original [Calculator challenge](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v/~016) exercise from Scrimba's "Learn JavaScript" course.
